# In Defense of the "Boring" Building

"Boring" buildings are important. Not everything needs to be a Gherkin or a
Sidney Opera House. On the contrary&mdash;most buildings shouldn't be. The reason those
buildings stand out is that they are unique in their environment; they stand out
from the other buildings around them, and draw the eye. This is a good thing:
they provide a sense of place, and can act as important landmarks that a person
walking around can use to orient themselves.

If every building is unique, then no building is unique.
