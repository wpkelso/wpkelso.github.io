# Post Title

I've learned over the past six months that coffee shops (or cafes, I'm treating them as the same type of establishment) are probably one of the best third places that can exist in an area. They are extremely flexible establishments that can cater to a wide variety of times, people, and cultures, and&mdash;as Starbucks and it's innumerous global locations have shown, able to exist just about anywhere that a concentration of people do.

Of course this shouldn't be surprising, there is a reason the general idea has been around so long across so many different cultures worldwide.

If you're the more romantic type, they're wonderful places for chance meetings, stolen glances, and small conversation. If you're feeling a bit more industrious, cafes are a great place to sit down with a drink or a snack and get through a backlog of work or a stack of papers to read. They can be a place to catch up with friends you haven't seen in a while over a bite to eat; ultimately, a place where one can just&hellip; exist.

However, there is an issue here: this model tends to work at its best in areas where people move _in_ an area, rather than _through_ an area. Extrapolating this beyond the coffee shop, when intentionality is enforced through transportation, the vibrancy of the public space is lost, and it's purpose is eroded.

## Enforced Intentionality

To understand what I'm saying here, I want to first tangent on what I mean by the difference between moving _in_ an area and moving _through_ an area.

When driving, there is an intentionality to the destination of your travel. Even when your destination is immediately unknown, your end destination is unlikely to be right where you are; you are separate from the environment you are in, insulated by a layer of metal and glass. Thus, you are only travelling _through_ a place.

On the other hand, when travelling _in_ an area, you are a part of the social fabric of that place. Every passerby is a possible interaction, a possible connection that you can choose conciously to engage with or not. Every storefront, restaurant, park, or plaza is a location you can just exist in, even if you're only passing through to some other destination.

The importance of this unintentionality can be derived from the importance of the third place (the concept of the "Third Place" is not the focus of this post, but further reading on it can be found [here](link)). A place where we can be allowed to just exist, as humans, rather than as an employee; as humans, rather than a mother, father, sister, or brother; this is extremely important to human happiness and fulfillment.

When we enforce intentionality in our movement, we take away from this freedom. Now, we are going somewhere explicitly to be something&mdash;to be someone. Everywhere in-between doesn't matter, we can't as easily wander down rabbit holes, we can't learn more about where we are, because we have an explicit place to be at a specific time, potentially with specific people.

## How the Built Environment Enforces Intentionality in Movement

In the United States, the largest contributor towards this strict enforcement of intentionality is the built environment. In many ways, I would argue it is *the source* of this phenomenon. Nowhere is this more true than in our modern suburbs.

A rural environment encourages&mdash;even expects, that one is somewhat self-reliant. The population density makes it simply infeasible for any major collectivization and sharing of resources. In counterpoint, an urban environment requires the expectation that no-one is truly self-reliant. It goes contrary to the entire purpose of the urban model of resource collectivization and sharing.

In between these two regional classifications sits the suburbs. Post-Levittown they have become sprawling tracts of essentially rural land, with residents still expecting urban amenities. Surely anyone can see the conflicting interests in that sentence.
