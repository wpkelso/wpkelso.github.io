# Introduction

If I were to say that I was a life-long avid reader, I would be lying. Instead, I've had an on-and-off relationship with long-form text. 
In primary school, I read constantly; when I got to secondary school, that pretty much stopped. 
In University, I started reading long-form texts again, but I found I wasn't as much interested in the fantasies and fictions that populated the many pages of my younger years. 
Instead I wanted to learn. 
I wanted to know.
