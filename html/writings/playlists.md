Thesis: Creating a playlist will often make the individual music tracks
contained less interesting, because the disrupt the original context of a song
in its album, diminishing the song's narrative importance.

The rise of the playlist --- a collection of miscellaneous songs, often with
a specific theme --- has conincided with the rise of music streaming.
This is by no means a new phenomenon, as mixtapes have existed and been popular
for a long time; however, services like Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music have
largely built themselves around the user-created playlist.
In particular, one type of playlist is native to every platform, and is
"curated" by users: the "Liked Songs" playlist.
