			<h2>Why Blackbird?</h2>
			<p>
				A while ago, I was searching for a new tag to use in online
				games. I decided to achieve that by manipulating my name into
				something else. I went from &ldquo;Will&rdquo;, to
				&ldquo;Willow&rdquo;, to &ldquo;Wirlo&rdquo;, then
				finally settled on &ldquo;Mirlo&rdquo;. Unbeknownst to me at the time, Mirlo
				was already a word&mdash;Blackbird&mdash;in Spanish. When it
				came time to name this site, I decided to just go with the
				english name, and thus settled on &ldquo;Blackbird.&rdquo; Besides, they've
				a pleasant song.
