# Site Goals

> [!abstract] Goals:
>
> 1. Have a static, html-first site to house showcases of my projects, a full cirriculum vitae, and a simple blog-lite component
> 2. Showcase and improve my design skills and thinking through a well-considered site experience
> 3. Explore web accessibility and expand my knowledge of important considerations when it comes to accessible design
> 4. Have fun designing and constructing this website

## Why HTML-First?

My intention for this site is to be HTML-first, using javascript wherever necessary, but not as the primary language. There are a couple reasons for this:

1. I don't want to learn a framework to build this. I don't think it's necessary for what I'm trying to do, and I don't think it will make what I'm trying to do particularly easier--although I'm saying this particular part without much of any prior research.
2. Despite this, I intend to still use CSS, as I want design consistency throughout the site, and universal styling of elements that can be overridden is in my opinion preferrable to having to update every element that follows a certain style every time I want to update said style.
    - This also includes using sass as a pre-processor, rather than writing pure css, as I want to be able to use features from it's superset.
3. I want someone who want's to learn the same things I currently am to be able to do so directly from the website, not just from the repo where this site is hosted. That means making it as easy as possible to view and understand the source files, rather than obscuring everything with a lot of build steps.

## Why create a site in the first place?

In a sense, I want to learn "how the other half lives." I am by training a systems programmer. As such, my understanding of web technologies (and to an extent even general applications programming) is quite limited, and really expands only when I pursue projects like this.

Additionally, I want a place to explore and expirement, unburdened by the restrictions of other site frameworks  or generators. Those probably won't give me the understanding I want, so instead I'll go right to the source and learn from there.
